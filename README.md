# SRT AI Translator

SRT AI Translator is an automatic subtitle translation tool that leverages the advanced translation model from Hugging Face (facebook/nllb-200-3.3B). This tool enables efficient and easy translation of subtitles from movies and videos into various languages.

## Requirements

Before using SRT AI Translator, ensure that you meet the following requirements:

- **Python 3.12** or higher

  - `torchaudio`
  - `srt`
  - `huggingface_hub`
  - `keyring`
  - `tkinter` (usually included with Python)
- **Translation Model**: The "facebook/nllb-200-3.3B" model from Hugging Face will be downloaded automatically.
- **CUDA**: For NVIDIA GPUs (optional, recommended for faster translation).
- **Hugging Face API Token**: To access the translation model on Hugging Face.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SRTAITranslator.git
   cd SRTAITranslator
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

3. **Enter Required Information**
   - **Source Language**: Enter the source language code (e.g., `eng_Latn`).
   - **Target Language**: Enter the target language code (e.g., `por_Latn`).
   - **Hugging Face API Token**: Enter your Hugging Face token.

4. **Translate the File**
   Click the "Start Translation" button and wait while the software translates the SRT file content. Progress will be shown on the progress bar.

5. **Retrieve the Translated File**
   The translated file will be saved in the `Downloads` folder with the prefix `translated_`.

## Known Issues

- **CUDA Compatibility**: Ensure that you have the correct CUDA version installed for your GPU. The installer script uses CUDA 12.4 by default.
- **Installation Errors**: If you encounter issues during installation, try running the `Module Installation.py` script with administrator privileges or in a virtual environment.
